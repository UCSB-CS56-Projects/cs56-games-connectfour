Plan to Refactor Entire Code Base
=================================
The code health at its current state isn't looking great and we believe a MVC design pattern can take the convoluted code
and reorganize it so that every file has a logical place in the following directories: Model, View, and Controller.
The goal of the refactor is to break unhealthy relationships between files so that each file can be placed in a directory
that has clearly defined roles. In doing so, we would be following the single responsibility principle and future classes 
working on this project will be able to clearly see the function and role of every module.

#Reviewing the current code
The current source files are placed into three different directories: AI, GUI, and Logic. Upon brief scanning of the code
we can immediately see files that have unhealthy relationships. For example, there are multiple modules in the GUI directory
such as Board.java the handles logic. The board itself should not have knowledge on how to handle logistics of the connect 
four game. The MVC model aims to refactor this code so that the code can be more readable and a convenient reoccuring theme 
of the MVC design pattern shown below can be established.
