# F17 Final Remarks
The code allows user(s) to play a game of connect four; either against AI or a multiplayer 1 on 1 version. The features are already plentiful, but there are some more that can be implemented (shown in the issues below). There's a lot of refactoring that can be done throughout the whole code base. There are a lot of redundancies in the code that could be simplified using a smarter implementation. Some advice we have for the next class is to carefully read and understand the role of every class in the code base before beginning implementation.

# Issues
- Subclass JFrame and JButton to set preferences (Center alignment, font) automatically. [#87](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/87). Currently, all JFrame's and JButton's have the same features (title, listeners, etc.). Subclass both of these classes in order to automatically set the features upon object creation.

- Refactor creation of Clip objects in MusicPlayer.java [#86](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/86) Currently, lines 30-38 are almost exactly the same as lines 59-67 in MusicPlayer.java. Refactor this code by writing a functions that is called in both of these spots, instead of repeating the same lines of code.

- Allow user to pick a specific song [#85](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/85) Currently, users can click "Change Music", which randomly selects a song and starts playing it. Users should be allowed to pick a specific song by clicking on a button.

- Check win (and draw win) function [#81](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/81) The check win functions in the Board.java file and the draw win functions in the BoardDisplay.java file have a very similar functions to check and draw: horizontal, vertical, main diagonal, and anti diagonal wins. I believe this can be refactored in order to remove redundancy in the code base.

- AI Agent [#80](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/80) There are currently a decent amount of redundant code when utilizing the three AI modules. (Lines 227-287) of Board.java. We can create an AI Agent interface that can implement all the AI's to handle this redundancy.

 - Board Color Select [#79](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/79) The board color select logic spread throughout the project is not very reasonable. It doesn't make sense to assign colors to random ints (especially if the ints aren't even sequential). We should utilize Java's enum data type to make a more readable code base concerning selection of board color.
