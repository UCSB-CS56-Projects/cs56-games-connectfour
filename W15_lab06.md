Possible Improvements:

	Low Hanging Fruit:
	- FIXED: Rules Button - Created a new displayRules function and uncommented action call. (Rules button works now)

	Program Modifications:
	- Simulate the game more realistically by having the circles descend from the top of the column til they reach 
	  their appropriate stopping point. 
	- When the game is over, continue the descent by letting all circles fall from the bottom of the Board. 
    - Add a button where a player can be substituted in mid-game for the computer.
    - Create a yellow/red circle in the in-game menu that indicates whos turn it is.


	Code Suggestions:
	- Fix the currently commented out Rules button, and add a more detailed description of this code. (DONE)
	- Define the screen and font size at the beginning of the program versus using numbers depicting pixels. This would allow other aspects of the code to be modified without changing each call to drawDtring or setFont individually. 
	- Modify build.xml with appropriate comments.
	- Add a Defensive mode (such as Easy and Advanced) in which the simulated player only tries to block the single player. 


	Additional Suggestions:
	- In ReadMe, create short descriptions to what all of the different files do for the program.
	- add more javadoc comments that explain what each of the functions do.
	
	GUI suggestions:
	- Make the frame a constant size instead of different sizes for the startScreen and the game board.
	- Add a Rules button to the in-game menu.
