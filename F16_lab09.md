*Make the AI feel more "alive"
Issue #66, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/66
The idea for this one is that the AI should have a "personality" depending on the difficulty of the AI. When a move is made, the AI
says something to the player. Bonus Points if the AI's personality matches its name. Assuming that it doesn't violate copyright.
~200 pts.

*Improve the Normal and Advanced AI
Issue #71, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/71
The AI have been stadily improved over the course of the project. Since the Normal and Advanced AI are very close in difficulty, it
stand to reason that they need an upgrade. Set the difficulty of the Normal AI to where the Advanced AI is now and improve the
Advanced AI even further to provide a greater challenge to players.
~400 pts.

*Improve Easy AI
Issue #70, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/70
As mentioned before, the AI have been improving. That said, the Easy AI have recieved no improvements at all. Make it so that the 
Easy AI can detect when it has a winning move available.
~150 pts.

Good luck. Happy Coding.
