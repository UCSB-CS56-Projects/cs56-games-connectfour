*Make the AI feel more "alive"
Issue #66, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/66
The idea for this one is that the AI should have a "personality" depending on the difficulty of the AI. When a move is made, the AI
says something to the player. Bonus Points if the AI's personality matches its name. Assuming that it doesn't violate copyright.
~200 pts.

*Improve the Normal and Advanced AI
Issue #71, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/71
The AI have been stadily improved over the course of the project. Since the Normal and Advanced AI are very close in difficulty, it
stand to reason that they need an upgrade. Set the difficulty of the Normal AI to where the Advanced AI is now and improve the
Advanced AI even further to provide a greater challenge to players.
~400 pts.

*Improve Easy AI
Issue #70, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/70
As mentioned before, the AI have been improving. That said, the Easy AI have recieved no improvements at all. Make it so that the 
Easy AI can detect when it has a winning move available.
~150 pts.

*Add Unbeatable AI
Issue #74, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/74
Connect 4 is a solved game. The first player to move can force a move on or before move 41. Implement an AI for singleplayer that always moves first and always wins. 
~300 pts.

*Draw Triggered Unnecessarily
Issue #76, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/76
There currently exists an issue where "Draw" will pop up despite the existence of sequences of winning moves.
~200pts

*Draw Remains Past Undo
Issue #77, https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-connectfour/issues/77
When "Draw" pops up, it doesn't go away when "Undo" is pressed even if "Undo" opens up a winning move sequence.
~150pts


Good luck. Happy Coding.
