Thank you Alexis for the heads up. What exact numbers did you answer because I beleive we are still missing some of the analysis required. My email is alexisjimenez@umail.ucsb.edu if you need to contact me.


README.md
--------- 
Connect 4 is made out of an implementation of both the Board and Circle class.
Whoever makes 4 consecutive circles horizontally, diagonally, or vertically
wins the game.

This file vaguely introduces the overall construction of the game connect 4.
It needs to be more detailed in the implementation of the game
and how each of the classes interact with each other in order to functionally
produce the game.

ISSUES
-------
Readme.md: Improve this text file so the user knows how to use the game and also
how to run it. This text file must be user friendly.

Rules: There is currently no rules file in this program. A new file must be
implemented with the rules to Connect 4.

Javadoc: Some source code has parts of its code that has no javadoc comments.
These files must be found and the javadoc comments must be added.

ANT Targets
-----------
Clean: This target deletes uncecessary files and directories in our repo.

Compile: This targets compiles all the code listed in the build.xml file.

Run: this targets runs the program starting at Board.java.


Running and Compiling
---------------------
We first compiled the program and all files were compiled. We then ran the
program and the program succesfully ran.
